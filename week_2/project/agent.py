"""
ResearchBot: Week 2 Project Starter
======================================
This file currently makes a basic single-turn call to OpenRouter.
Your job is to evolve it into a full research agent with:
  - Web search and web fetch tools (using OpenAI SDK tool calling)
  - An agent loop that iterates until the model stops requesting tools
  - A Textual TUI with a chat panel and a tool activity log
  - Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+L (clear display), Ctrl+K (clear history), Ctrl+Q (quit),
    and at least one more of your choice

Start by getting this file working, then add tools, then add the TUI.
Don't try to build everything at once.
